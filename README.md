In this project, I leverage the power of prominent libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy to conduct an in-depth analysis of the dataset. Throughout the endeavor, a series of intriguing questions were posed, and my pursuit involved unraveling insightful answers. The process entailed not only the meticulous construction of graphs but also the creation of informative pivot tables to distill valuable patterns and trends from the data.
